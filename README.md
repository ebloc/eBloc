## About eBloc
A [bloc](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bloc) is defined as a group of people or countries that are connected by a treaty or agreement or by common goals. eBloc is a blockchain based infrastructure that will be built on top of [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org) smart contracts platform. [IPFS](https://ipfs.io) distributed file system platform may be used to store large data. eBloc will be used to support e-Science related academic and research activities. We started our eBloc efforts in June 2016. We invite other institutions for collaboration in building eBloc . The following is a sample applications for which we plan to use the eBlock infrastructure. The infrastructure can, of course, be used for other applications also.
